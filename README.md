# MyPortfolio
Date: November 7th, 2025
Time: 2:20 AM ( I have a morning class around 9 am)
Extimated Deadline: Before 2026
Description:
How could I share my projects and experiences? 
Therefore, I decided to create a portfolio. Apparently, it is popular, and I have always wanted to have one.
First, I decided to create a template to see how it would look using Canva (it is like a list of the recipes you need to make the cake or turkey).
Then, I will implement the design and turn it into a website using HTML and CSS, hoping to find the right rules and designs.
I am so excited for this journey!Here is the template for the portfolio, if you want to take a look!
